### Future of this project/Maintenance

**NONE**; This is just a diploma final year project I made in Kotlin as I didn't have an iDevice.

This codebase is in no way mature enough for production environment
as it is *good enough for my college*.

You have been warned, this project (at least at the time of writing this),
has no remote database code-blocks, and hence **will not scale** *at all*.


### License

**MIT**

Use it as you wish,
I do not care.
